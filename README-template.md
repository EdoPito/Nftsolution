# Frontend Mentor - NFT preview card component solution

This is a solution to the [NFT preview card component challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/nft-preview-card-component-SbdUL_w0U). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects. 


## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements



## My process

First added more semantic to HTML and then created my card, only added images once the text was all in line and separated. 





### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


**Note: These are just examples. Delete this note and replace the list above with your own choices**

### What I learned

Still improving my flexbox abilities




### Continued development

I need to find out more about hover effects - as I could not do the hover effect of the image
I need to find out more about the position - as I honestly did that bit by using documentation but would not know how to use it on my own
